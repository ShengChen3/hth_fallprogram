I am interested in this data because I am a baseball fan and this data shows the stats for different baseball teams in the MLB. I think it would be really useful if I want to look at the stats for different teams and their best players according to stats. Perhaps I can also find the correlation between different factors like how the avg bat age affects their performance. The dataset can also be used to look at the list of managers for different teams and we can see that some of them switched between teams. 

10 Questions that I have:
1. Which manager leads the best team?
2. How can I use the data to interpret why some managers switch jobs?
3. Does attendance affect performance of the teams?
